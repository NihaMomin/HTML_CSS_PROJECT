Page Basics:

tag -> instruction
tag name -> specfiction fucntion/ instruction
nested tags -> tags within tag
title -> webpage title (bookmark uses this name bydefault)
head -> title and meta tag nested inside head tag
meta tage doesnt have closing tag -> void tags -> single line instruction -> self closing tags
e.g <meta charset = "">, where charset is called an attribute
doctype tag -> tells browser that file contains html content
html tag -> contains:  head (to setup page, and ocntent inside doesnt show on the page) and body tag (content appeasrs on page)
body -> contain all veiwbale content
whitespaces -> additional whitespaces are ignored when html is rendered on browser
comment -> <!-- jaefbhf -->
html is not case sensitive HEAD = head tag 
file names -> .html or htm
use _ instead of name while naming files 


Text Basics:
heading tag -> h1,h2,h3 (we have 6 head tags in total)
p tag -> paragraph
break -> new line: br tag
bold text -> strong tag or b tag
italic -> em tag or i tag

Text Formatting:
section tag -> heading wise section seperation
article tag / aside tag -> seperate paragraph/ text
block quote -> quote (centre text)

Lists:
ordered list -> ol tag with li tags inside -> numbered
unordered list -> ul tag and li tag insides  -> bullets
list within list (nested ols/ uls within li), we can provide type attribute with it too for the type of bullets/ numbering (numner or alphabets (samll or capital))
definition list -> dt (term tag) and dd (description tag) (term and its def)

Images:
img tag
large images makes website slowers as they take longer to render (set width and height) so website set/ allocate specific size of page to that image and render other things
alt -> img name/ text (but not visible)
figure tag - >can figcaption tag too to caption the img, figure can have multipe images too
